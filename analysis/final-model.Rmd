## Final Topic Model

So finally we'll settle on the topic model with 30 topics and look at a couple of summaries based on that topic. 


```{r load-chunk1}
devtools::load_all()
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("code", "compare-clusters.R"))
```

```{r plot-cluster}
```

```{r plot-topic-distribution, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5}
```

```{r plot-topic-timeline, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 12}
```

## Color distributions by topic 

TODO: Paste in later.
