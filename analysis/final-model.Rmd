# Final model plots
Here are several plots based on the final color topics.
1. Color themes 
2. Distribution of themes 
3. Distribution of themes over time. 

## Lego color themes
This plot represents each topic as the distribution of colors. These are the 'color urns' that the Lego themes are drawn from.


```{r load-chunk1}
devtools::load_all()
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("code", "final-model-plots.R"))

```

```{r plot-topic-distribution, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
```

## Lego theme timeline

```{r plot-topic-timeline, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 10}
```


### The topic palette

Here we create a palette to represent each topic in the last two plots. I use a blend of the top two colors in each topic. 

```{r load-chunk2}
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("code", "final-model-grid.R"))
```

```{r plot-final-topics, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```
